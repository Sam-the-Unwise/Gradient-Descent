# GradientDescent



10 points if your github repo includes a README.org (or README.md etc) file with a link to the source code of your GradientDescent function, and an explanation about how to run it on the data sets.
10 points if, instead of writing code that is specific to each data set, you write a for loop over data sets and parameter values, and include a link to this code in your README. For example you could create a data/ directory with sub-directories data/spam/ etc, each with data/spam/X.csv, data/spam/y.csv, data/spam/parameters.csv (which would store a stepSize and maxIterations value to use for each data set), then your code can loop over these data/ sub-directories, and create the corresponding tables/figures for each one.
